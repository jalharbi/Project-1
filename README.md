### How to Play 
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that has two players, player X and player O who, the first player start his turn by filling the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who fills the spaces with three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### Techniques 
I used three programs:
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript.

## Things I wish to add 
I used javascript in my game, and through my early experience with my classmate who used jQuery, I think jQuery event listener process is easier than JavaScript. I struggled with adding removeEventListeninr in JavaScript, whereas if I used jquery, the method 'off click ' to stop eventListener is much easier than JS. I also wish if I used flexBox from the beginning of my project but for sure I am going to use flexBox in the coming projects. So proud of my first project and challenge!

## Thank For 
Thanks for all of the team of WDI, much love for GA.
